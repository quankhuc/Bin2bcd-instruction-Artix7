# Bin2bcd-instruction-Artix7
In this lab, I added a new instruction to the RISC computer. The instruction is called bin2bcd, which is used to convert a binary number to a binary-coded decimal number. Each number is stored into a different regiters. The Lab 5.xpr file can be used with Xilinx tool to see the simulation of this instruction. All tcl window commands are stored in lab5textcommand.txt so that these commands can be pasted into the tcl window to save time that a new user does not need to find each command.
