# Bin2bcd-instruction-Artix7
In this lab, I added a new instruction to the RISC computer. The instruction is called bin2bcd, which is used to convert a binary number to a binary-coded decimal number. Each number is stored into a different regiters. The Lab2.xpr file can be used with Xilinx tool to see the simulation of this instruction.
